# Mathematical Function Visualizer (C++)

## Overview
This application is a mathematical engine designed for real-time function visualization and analysis. Developed in C++ using the **graphics.h (WinBGIm)** library, the project focuses on manual coordinate mapping and algorithmic expression parsing.

## Academic Context
Developed as a final project for the **Introduction to Programming** course at the **Faculty of Computer Science, UAIC (FII)**. This project serves as a demonstration of fundamental algorithmic logic and manual UI rendering before transitioning to Object-Oriented Programming.

## Before installing!
**Compatibility Note:** This application was developed using **Code::Blocks 17.12** in conjunction with the **WinBGIm package**. To compile and run this project, ensure your environment is configured with these specific dependencies.
